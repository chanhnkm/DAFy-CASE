## Introduction
 DAFy CASE is an algorithm design tool using flowchart. Remember to follow a self-established drawing scheme based on __Structured Programming__. For example, the user cannot draw the flow line arbitrarily, and only the control structure should be combined.
 #### Features
  - _Standardized_   
  Flowcharts have no clear rules for constructing streamlines. Different ways of drawing may make the same idea seem different. Therefore, as described above, it follows a drawing method that has been established and standardized by itself. The user should express the control logic only with the combination of control structures. In addition, only reserved words, operators, and symbols should be used, and identifiers should be determined according to rules. This is limited to the rule checking capabilities built into the application. However, this function can be turned off.   
  - _Intuitive_   
  Intuitive operation allows you to get used to the application quickly and easily. One usage video below will suffice.   
  - _Clear_   
  The flow charting method followed by the application is simple and allows the logic to be clearly expressed. The repeating structure repeats only when it is true, and the selection structure always applies consistent rules such as left to true and right to false. Even those who are new to flowcharts will be able to easily understand the control logic of this.
  #### Functions  
 - File Processing
 - Edit
 - Format
