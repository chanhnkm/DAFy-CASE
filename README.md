## Introduction
 DAFy CASE is an algorithm design tool using __flowchart__. Note this application follow the self-established way of drawing based on __Structured Programming__. For example, the user cannot draw the flow line as his/her please. Instead, the user must combine control structures.
 #### Features
  - _Standardized_   
  Flowchart has no clear rules for drawing flow lines. Different ways of drawing make the same idea seem different. Therefore, DAFy CASE follows the way of drawing which we have established and standardized. The user should express the control logic only with the combination of control structures. In addition, only certain keywords, operators, and symbols should be used, and identifiers should be declared according to rules. This is limited to the rule-checking function by DAFy CASE. However, this function can be turned off.   
  - _Intuitive_   
  Intuitive way to use allows you to get used to DAFy CASE quickly and easily. One lecture video below will suffice.   
  - _Clear_   
  It is simple that the way of drawing flowchart followed by DAFy CASE. And it allows users clearly express his/her logic. DAFy CASE applies consistent rules: iteration structure iterates only when the result of its conditional expression is true, and selection structure goes left when the result of its conditional expression is true or goes right when the result is false, etc. So even those who are new to flowcharts will be able to easily understand the control logic of this.
  #### Functions  
 - File Processing
 - Edit
 - Format
 - Insert Symbol
 - Create Control Structure
